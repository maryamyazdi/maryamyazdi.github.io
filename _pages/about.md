I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the [University of Isfahan](https://www.ui.ac.ir/EN) in 2023, where I was supervised by [Dr. Reza Ramezani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QDa3wGgAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests lie at the intersection of trustworthy AI and inference optimization, where I advocate for improved transparency, robustness, and efficiency in the widespread applications of AI.

I served as a teaching assistant in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Isfahan during my undergraduate studies. Following graduation, I started working as a Data Scientist at [DataCoLab](https://datacolab.co.uk/).

Through hands-on problem-solving in both academic and industry settings, I've developed a robust foundation that I'm eager to build upon through pursuing a PhD in Computer Science.



### Research Interests

- Trustworthy Machine Learning
- Inference Optimization
- Security and Safety

In my free time, I enjoy spontaneous oil painting or going out for a run. I am also very interested in music and play the piano.
