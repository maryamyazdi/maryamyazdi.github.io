I graduated with a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the [University of Isfahan](https://www.ui.ac.ir/EN) in 2023, where I was supervised by [Prof. Reza Ramezani](https://engold.ui.ac.ir/~r.ramezani/). My primary research interests are in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

I have worked as a teaching assistant in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Isfahan. Following graduation, I established my career as a Data Scientist at [DataCoLab](https://datacolab.co.uk/). My experiences in both academia and industry have allowed me to deepen my knowledge through real-world use cases. Unlocking the fascinating potential of AI to enhance people's lives is what drives me through my adventures.

### Research Interests

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Knowledge Extraction
- Natural Language Processing

In my free time, I enjoy going for a run or creative painting. I am also very interested in music and play the piano.
