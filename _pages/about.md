I graduated with a B.Sc. in Computer Software Engineering from the [University of Isfahan](https://www.ui.ac.ir/EN) in 2023, where I was supervised by [Prof. Reza Ramezani](https://engold.ui.ac.ir/~r.ramezani/). My primary research interests are in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

I have worked as a teaching assistant in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Isfahan. After graduation, I started my career as a Data Scientist at [DataCoLab](https://datacolab.co.uk/).

My academic and professional experiences have allowed me to deepen my knowledge and sharpen my skills through real-world probelm solving. Unlocking the fascinating potential of AI to help people live a better life is what motivates me through my adventures.

### Research Interests

- Large Language Models (robustness, various application domains)
- Knowledge Extraction
- Natural Language Processing

In my free time, I enjoy spontaneous oil painting or going out for a run. I am also very interested in music and play the piano.
