I graduated with a B.Sc. in Computer Software Engineering from the [University of Isfahan](https://www.ui.ac.ir/EN) in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Reza Ramezani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QDa3wGgAAAAJ&hl=en). My primary research interests are in Natural Language Processing and Trustworthy Machine Learning.

I have worked as a teaching assistant in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Isfahan. Following graduation, I started my career as a Data Scientist at [DataCoLab](https://datacolab.co.uk/).

My academic and professional experiences have deepened my knowledge and sharpened my skills through solving real-world problems. My passion for exploring how AI can improve people's lives motivates me throughout my journey.



### Research Interests

- Large Language Models (robustness, various application domains)
- Knowledge Extraction
- Trustworthy Machine Learning

In my free time, I enjoy spontaneous oil painting or going out for a run. I am also very interested in music and play the piano.
