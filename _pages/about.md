I am a graduate student with a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the [University of Isfahan](https://www.ui.ac.ir/EN) in 2023. I was supervised by [Prof. Reza Ramezani](https://engold.ui.ac.ir/~r.ramezani/). My primary research interests are in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

I have worked as a teaching assistant for the Department of Computer Science at the University of Isfahan. Following graduation, I landed my job as a Data Scientist at [DataCoLab](https://datacolab.co.uk/). My experiences in academia and industry have allowed me to deepen my knowledge through real-world use cases.

The fascinating potential of AI to elevate human lives has always been exciting to me. I'm passionate to unlock it through discovering new techniques or leveraging the existing ones to enhance our systems.

### Research Interests

- Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications
- Natural Language Processing
- Information Retrieval

In my free time, I enjoy going for a run or intuitively oil painting. I am also very interested in music and play the piano.
